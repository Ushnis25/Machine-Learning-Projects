This model of "CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS" is created with the help of two popular ML algorithms "Binary Classifier" and "Artificial Neural Network".
The model can be used to detect churn in any sector.
This project takes the data of a retail banking sector and using FeedForward Neural Networks predicts the "customer churn".

The model is evaluated using "Confusion Matrix" and "AUC-ROC Curve".

Given attached is the Documentation of the Entire Project, the Presentation as well as the Source Code Files.
